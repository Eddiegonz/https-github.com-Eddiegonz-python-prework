                <h1>A little about me</h1>
                <p><strong>I was born in San Diego and was growing up as the 1990's just came around. After a short time my parents chased
                    my family over to New Jersey. We had stayed in New Jersey ever since. I had gone to schools in the city of 
                    Cherryhill after the move, more on that later. I had moved into a nice dead end street where myself and brother
                    had free reign to run around to nearby woods, fields and abandoned factory. We were very outdoorsy types and made
                    a lot of friends who we added to our crew. Everyone brought something different to our group, and also enjoyed our 
                    energetic lifestyle. When to night we played a lot of video games of the 90's.

        <h3>My Schooling</h3>
        <p><strong>When it came to College I had gone to Camden County College interested in Computer Science I then obtained my Associates degree in 
            Liberal Arts and Sciences with a Science focus. I Strayed from my dream or a career in Computers, and began a new study and continued my 
            education into a career into Criminal justice, which I had studied very briefly at Rutgers University before becoming a Police Officer. 
            After almost 9 and a half years into my prior Career, I wanted to get back to my roots of what I am interest in, Computing. Being a 90's 
            kid I was always facinated by computers and techology so becoming a web developer would really encompass most of my career goals, and so 
            I'm here with Coding Temple!

            <p><strong><b>Due to hobbies like anime I have been able to meet new people and gain exposure to diffrent types of food. In a lot of anime theres
                a lot of varying foods, but a lot are japanese. Seeing foods all the time like this had my brain asking itself "hey why not go out and try
                some authentic Japanese Ramen?". I had then began looking up local Ramen shops which allowed me to find like minded and similar interested
                people who became regulars like myself. These exposures to different cultural food allowed me to see how significant what looks like a 
                bowl of soup to Americans is a very important cultural way of life in Japan.
